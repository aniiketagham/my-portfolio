With over a year in Data Science & Analytics, I’ve worked across 2 firms and completed 10+ projects. My work spans various industries, covering end-to-end project development, from data exploration and modeling to deployment and automation.

Hands on diverse skill set that includes Analytics, Machine Learning, Visualizations, Forecasting & Time Series, Programming languages (Python, R, SQL) and NLP.

Passionate about transforming raw data into actionable insights, I specialize in tackling complex business challenges through a combination of analytical thinking, machine learning techniques, and effective communication.

I am always eager to learn, innovate, and contribute to organizations that aim to make dollars from data. Let’s connect and create data-driven success together!
