Welcome to Quasilinear Musings! This blog serves as a playground for me to experiment
with ideas and share some of my findings. It's a reflection of my career path and
interests - especially on the technical side of things. For more information, check
out my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/timlrx).

I am proficient in R, Python and Javascript. My current interests are in the areas of
network analytics, full-stack development, technology and labour economics so expect
to see more of these stuff in the future! This blog is bootstrapped from the awesome
[Tailwind Nextjs Starter Blog Template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog)
(coincidentally written by me). Source code for the website is available at my
[Github page](https://github.com/timlrx/timlrx.com).
